# My iOS Playground

This repository contains a project created when trying out (and learning) Swift. It will have a lot of terribly written stuff. You probably don't want to mimic the stuff I do here.

## Learning sources

* [Swift Docs](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/documentation/the-swift-programming-language/thebasics/)
* [CS193p Stanford Lectures](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/2023)
